    description:
      "Automated data processing workflows in AWS RedShift for data cleaning and pre-processing, managing processed data in Amazon S3 and reducing data handling time from 1 hour to 5 minutes through reusable SQL queries. Utilized PySpark for statistical measure calculation and Seaborn for exploratory data analysis and visualization. Developed machine learning models in AWS SageMaker using scikit-learn, applying K-means and KNN for clustering, multivariate time series forecasting, and XGBoost for predictive modeling while performing feature engineering to enhance performance. Evaluated prediction accuracy using area under the curve (AUC) and improved respiratory disease prediction accuracy by 17%.",
